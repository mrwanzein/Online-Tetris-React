# Online-Tetris-React
Final project for Concordia Full Stack web dev bootcamp
 
### Summary

  A platform where Tetris players can play other Tetris players live. Build with the MERN stack: **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, **Node** and **Socket.io** for the network.
  The app is far from done, but the mvp version is ready to get an idea of what it can offer and its potential.
  
  To test, `npm install` in the root folder and in the server folder. Then, `yarn start` in the server folder and `yarn start` in the root folder.
